# Instructions
To install or explore this component:

1) Follow the Quick Start here: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components (Note, install the pre-release plugin if you already have SFDX installed! Otherwise, you will get some gnarly errors!)
2) Clone this repository
3) Open your local folder for this repository in VS code.
4) Create a scratch org (or use your existing pre-release scratch org if you already have one)
5) Push the source.
6) Add the relatedList component via Lightning App Builder. It should work on the home page, a record detail page, or in a lightning app.
Make sure to define the "Object API Name" as well as the "List View Name" in the Lightning App Builder properties.
